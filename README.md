# d3-twodim

Helps create two-dimensional representations of data using scatter plots, Splatterplots and subsampled scatterplots, given 2D data.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-twodim`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/uwgraphics/d3-twodim/releases/latest).

## To-do list

- [x] Add ability to brush over graph (rectangle)
- [ ] Add axes labels to scatterplot object
- [ ] Add ability to select points (click and CTRL/SHIFT+click)
- [ ] Add ability to lasso points
- [ ] Add ability to programmatically select points
- [ ] Allow user to order points (e.g. draw these points as background and those as foreground to see distributions); this is tricky when we're passing indices around and not properties of the objects themselves, like an identifier
- [x] Obtain information about points that are selected
- [ ] Allow user to see statistics about selected points (in relation to background)
- [ ] Allow interaction with drop-downs to select relevant dimensions for the user, or search for particular text of a point

- [ ] Add legend component (labels visual variables)
- [ ] Add pairwise correlation matrix component (shows level of correlation between two features)

- [ ] Add splatterplot component
- [ ] Add subsampled graph option
- [ ] Add binning component


### less-likely additions
* Add labeling options (for outliers?)
